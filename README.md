# RSA-Cryptography

1. A program that is able to encrypt/decrypt text using the RSA algorithm.
   - Able to run two instances of this program and start chatting.
2. Another program that tries to break RSA and get the correct private key using plain-ciphertext pairs


## How to run

1. Run the sender and receiver program in any order
   python3 sender.py
   python3 receiver.py

2. Enter the number of bits of the key {n} in the sender program.
3. Enter the number of bits of the key {n} in the receiver program.
4. Enter the sender name to be displayed in the receiver program.
5. Enter the receiver name to be displayed in the sender program.
6. Start chatting!!!

## How to run the brute force attack
1. run the attack.ipynb file in jupyter notebook to be able to see the graphs and the results of the attack.

## How to run the analysis of the rsa algorithm
1. run the analysis.ipynb file in jupyter notebook to be able to see the graphs and the results of the analysis.
